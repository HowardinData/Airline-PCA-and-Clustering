# Goal
Our goal is to give them a better understaning of the people who fly Sun Country. We also want to make sure that online booking channels meet the expectations of twenty-first century travelers.
By doing so, Sun country could drag more customer and drive enrollment in Ufly Rewards, therefore help Sun Country to refine and market that program.
As a result, our analysis aimed to find meaningful customer segments to increase Ufly membership and Sun Country Airline (SCA) Website Booking. 


# Action
1. we visualized Sun Country's 3 years of flights data, 3M+ records, to get a better understanding of the whole dataset.
2. We aggreated the flights data into customer level in order to target on customer-based business problem.
3. To reduce noises and improve computation effeciency, we choose to implement PCA fisrt.
4. Then, we clustered our customers into meaningful groups based on similar flying traits using K-means, since it's a simple and powerful solution for complex dataset.
5. We looked at how long it takes to become a Ufly member. 
6. Finally, combining the cluster solution with the Ufly membership analysis, we recommended targeting specific clusters to improve Ufly membership and increase SCA Website bookings. 
7. These insights will allow Sun Country to understand better who its customers are and meet their customers' needs through Ufly membership.
